Durst manor, better known as the 'Death House', was a country manor the party encountered in the town of [[Daggerford]].  The house was possessed by the spirit of the bastard child of Mr. Durst, Walter, who had been ritually sacrificed by his wife Elisabeth.

The players successfully destroyed Walter's tortured form and escaped the house with the remains of his half siblings, Rose and Thorn Durst, who they laid to rest in near a ruined tower they found upon their escape.
