# Session Overview
The session starts with the party in [[Daggerford]], responding to the call to investigate the [[Death House]]. After some preamble to establish their shared history (there was a very eventful caravan guarding job!) the players make their way into the mists and enter the Dursts' house.

They have investigated the first three floors of the house, finding the relevant plot items along the way including the amber shard and all of the scripted handouts. They have fought, and defeated, the Animated armour and the Broom of animated attack.

The session ends at 09:00 pm game time. The players are on the 3rd floor of the Death House. Three hours remain until the Beast awakens.

Next session is set for the 28th of May 2024
