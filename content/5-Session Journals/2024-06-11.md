# Session Overview

Welcome, gentle reader. Pray sit a while and listen to this evenings tale as our brave adventurers find themselves stranded in a strange land.

Play started at the old ruined tower the party rested at. After awakening to bury the Durst children the party tended to their morning rituals. Kora, drawing her strength from the land, noticed that the very land here was tainted, evil running through it like oil over water. Oskar made his prayers to Lathander and instead of the brilliant warmth of sunrise felt only a wan, pale light as if from a great distance.

With the only way forward being the rough road to the West the party set off and spent most of the day walking. After nearly seven hours of walking they encountered a decaying corpse by the roadside along with a path leading into the woods. The path, marked by arrows carved into trees alongside 13 tallymarks, led them deeper into the woods and then into the mists before emerging back where they started.

Perplexed and footsore at this point the party resumed travel along the road, shortly coming to the gates of Barovia and getting a clear view of the valley before the mists descended again. Late at night they trudged into the village of Barovia which had clearly been the scene of some great battle. They were lead to The Blood of the Vine tavern where they met some of the notable locals for the first time, including [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and [[Bildrath Cantemir]]. After becoming acquainted with both they accepted Ismark's offer of hospitality for the night and accompanied him to the Burgomasters manor, where they met his sister [[Ireena Kolyanovich]].

Ismark had asked the party to accompany Ireenea to the town of [[Vallaki]] where he believes she will be safe from the attention of a vampire who has haunted their house these past few nights. The party overhear a conversation between the siblings where Ireenea, although initially reticent, agrees to go.  They thus gained the [[Escort Ireena]] quest.

Ismark leaves to organise a search party for the lost girl Gerturda while Ireenea settles the party into their rooms. Oskar and Hel take one room, Kora and Darius in the other (Gumshal takes a couch downstairs). Oskar finds a page torn from a book talking about Vampires (see handout).

Ismark returns after a few hours and the siblings prepare a meagre meal of turnip and rabbit stew which they share with the party. Everyone then retires to bed where they have a shared dream involving a mysterious old Crone [[Madam Eva]]. She bids them come to her at her tent in [[Tser Pool]] where she will read their fortunes - [[Get your fortune told]]. They awake with hearts pounding just in time to witness the March of the Dead - the shades of 100 souls of adventurers who had previously come to Bavoria only to meet their doom who now rise each night and march to the Castle. They also notice some bats watching them, which Hel tries to destroy with create water thinking they may be shape-changed vampires. Then Darius puts the moistened bats to sleep, a place to which the party slowly return without any further interruption.

Before dawn the next day they are awoken by Ismark who asks them to help lay his recently deceased father to rest, this being Ireenea's request before she leaves. They take the coffin to the village church where they find Father Donavich having a crisis of faith. His son, Doru, lead the rebellion against the devil and left with the majority of the towns young folk to storm the castle. As far as anyone knew none of them were seen again, but in fact Doru had been turned into a vampire spawn and sent back to the village to torment his father.

Donavitch had managed to briefly overpower Doru and has him confined to the churches undercroft, but the stress of seeing what his beloved son has become has left him a broken man and he cannot perform the rites to put the late Burgomaster to rest. He pleads with the party to venture into the undercroft and do what he could not and destroy the abomination wearing his sons face.

Upon entering the undercroft the party cannot see Doru, but he makes himself known. The boy knows what has been done to him and is fighting the curse that has been imposed on him to remain himself. He asks the party if they will allow him to prove his control by exposing him to fresh blood and then seeing if he can maintain control. While the rest of the party are deeply sceptical Darius believes that he should be given a chance at redemption and agrees to the request.

Doru passes the test and masters his hunger, but the party still view him as too much of a threat. Kora casts Moonbeam to destroy him causing Darius to leap to the boys defence, putting Kora into a magical sleep. There follow a tense few minutes while the party argue the morality of the situation out, ending when they take a vote on the boy's fate. By a 3 - 1 majority they decide he must be destroyed.

During this entire encounter the party barely engage with Doru, acting for most of the time as if he were no more than part of the furniture. Finally they put him to death (again), a fate the boy accepts with a calm dignity - asking only that they tell his father that he died as himself and not the beast. He then steps willingly into the light of Kora's Moonbeam and is burnt into ashes, taking with him any information about why he chose to lead the young of the village in rebellion against the devil, what happened on that fateful night, what he experienced at the castle and who his mysterious friend Alanik Ray might have been.

The session concluded with Father Donavitch, having recovered his faith, laying the former Burgomaster to rest and the party burying him in the ground. As they do so a flock of bats erupts from the belfry of the church, flying toward the castle. Our party are left facing the journey further west to Vallaki, and the mysterious Madam Eva at Tser Pool.
