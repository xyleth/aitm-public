# Session Overview

The party completed their investigation of the [[Death House]].  They encountered the spirits of Rose and Thorn, the Durst children, and learned from them about the circumstances of the families downfall.  The spirits pled with the party to take their mortal remains from the house and lay them to rest, to which the party agreed.  [[Darius]] and [[Lord Hel Forge]] allowed the spirits to possess them in order to accompany them into the basement.

In the basement the party discovered various horrors left by the cult established by Elisabeth Durst.  The encountered and defeated the cursed infant Walter, barely escaping the house before it imploded leaving only a dark pit where it once was.

As the mists cleared the party discovered that they were no longer in [[Daggerford]], finding them selves instead in a strange wood unknown to them.  They spied a ruined tower on a nearby hill which provided shelter for the night.  The sprits of the Durst children stood watch while the weary adventurers slept, and in the morning the party laid the children's bodies to rest in the ground.  Their plea met the spirits departed.

The party now turns it attention to discovering where they are, and the session ends.

The next session is scheduled for 2024-06-11
