The Durst Family lived in the [[Death House]] and were made up of four people:

* Elizabeth Durst, the wife
* Gustav Durst, the husband
* Thorn Durst, the son
* Rose Durst, the daughter
 
Thorn and Durst were twins. 
 Gustav Durst had an affair with the governess, Ms Clara, which resulted in the birth of Walter. Consumed by jealousy and rage, Elizabeth kills her husband and the governess, and (presumably assisted by the vampire [[Strahd]]) carries out a necromantic ritual to turn the bastard son into a monster.

The monster is killed by the party during [[2024-05-28 |the conclusion of the Death House quest]]. Of Elizabeth there is no trace.

There is another name mentioned in the writings on Elizabeth, Dasha, for which no further information was found. Dasha took care of the beast for some time whilst Elizabeth was absent.
