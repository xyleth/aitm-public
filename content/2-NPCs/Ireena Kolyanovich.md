Ireena is [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]'s sister. She joins the party before their [[2024-06-26|Journey to Tser Pool]], in an attempt to get away from the vampire [[Strahd]], who takes an interest in her because she has red hair. During their stay in [[Barovia]], the party find out that the vampire has already fed on Ireena twice, although he has not turned her into a vampire spawn.
