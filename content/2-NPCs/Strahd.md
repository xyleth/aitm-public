Strahd, full name Count Strahd von Zarovich, otherwise known as The Devil by the people of [[Barovia]], is a powerful vampire residing in [[Castle Ravenloft]]. He was the one that turned [[Doru]] into a vampire spawn and against his father [[Father Donavich]]. He is also the one who has been feeding on [[Ireena Kolyanovich]], who he has not turned but does pursue for her red hair.

The party encounter him first on their way to [[Tser Pool]] where he puts on a threatening and perfectly terrifying display of condescension, on [[2024-06-26| the road to Tser Pool]]. He travels by coach, pulled by two undead horses and driven by what looks like a vampire spawn coach driver. The question remains who turned the horses and whether they were tasty.
