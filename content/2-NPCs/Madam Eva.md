Madam Eva is a Vistani seeress, known throughout [[Barovia]] as having the gift of seeing the future.

She reached out to the party in a dream and bade them come to her at [[Tser Pool]] where she would read their fortune.

After the [[2024-06-26|journey to Tser Pool]] she reads the party a divination and tells them: beware the lone servant of darkness looking for secrets. Do not reveal lest you incur the wrath of the Master.

She also reads the party their cards. The reading is as follows:

1. The 9 of Glyphs: The Traitor. It represents the ancient foe and old house. The wandering soul will lead the party to him.
2. The 5 of Swords: The Myrmidon. Look for the den of wolves in the mountains overlooking the lakes. The treasure belongs to the Mother Night.
3. The 8 of Glyphs: The Bishop. There is a weapon that will defeat the Devil beyond a set of amber doors in a pile of treasure. 
4. The fourth card is the one who will help: The Mists. A Vistana wanders [[Saint Markovia]] near the mists.
5. The fifth card is the Enemy: The Marionette. Look to great heights, at the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby.
