Arturi is a man who also came from outside to [[Barovia]]. The party meet him at [[Tser Pool]] around the camp fire. This man is cursed to be visited by undead horrors every night, and the party is almost wiped out trying to protect him from this fate (which he insists is not necessary, he's used to it). He appears to be looking for [[Van Richten]].
