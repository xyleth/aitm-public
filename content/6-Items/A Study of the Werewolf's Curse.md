This is a manuscript the party won in the Game of Stories at [[Tser Pool]].  It reads as follows:

> Werewolves are among the most fearsome lycanthropes, bearing a curse as ancient as it is terrifying. For them, the affliction of lycanthropy transforms even the most civilized individual into a monstrous beast, warping the lines betwixt man and nature.
> 
> In its humanoid form, a werewolf retains many of the characteristics of its original identity, save for certain nuances such as heightened senses, an explosive temper, and an odd preference for rare meats. Over time, subtle features that hint at their animalistic nature begin to manifest. Nevertheless, it is in their wolf and hybrid forms that the true horror of the curse is revealed. A werewolf's hybrid form is particularly terrifying, with a muscular humanoid body crowned by the head of a ravenous wolf. It is capable of wielding weapons, though its favored means of attack are its devastating claws and powerful bite.
> 
> Werewolves typically abandon civilization soon after their transformation. Those who reject the curse flee in fear of harming their loved ones, whereas those who accept it fear exposure and the repercussions of their violent deeds. Out in the wild, they form packs, living in cohesion with ordinary wolves and dire wolves alike.
> 
> The most tragic aspect of lycanthropy is its transmission. A humanoid can contract this curse through a wound inflicted by a lycanthrope or through inheritance if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes.
> 
> The cursed have two paths: they may resist the beast within or embrace it. Those who resist bear unending strain—until the rising full moon triggers a compulsory and horrific transformation. These individuals often experience bloody, haunting dreams: echoes of the carnage wrought in their madness.
> 
> Some twisted souls, however, choose to accept their beastly nature. With time, they can master their abilities, calling upon the wolf's resilience and strength as they will. To do so, however, they must first perform a particular gruesome and foul act—one which I will decline to describe in these pages.
> 
> One sure way to identify an afflicted individual is the presence of a perpetually raw, bloody wound: the scar of the initial curse transmission. This wound never fully heals until the curse is lifted.
> 
> Beyond this mark, however, these creatures bear an extraordinary resilience. Conventional methods of harm prove ineffective in permanently subduing a werewolf. Only through the bite of silver or the chill of death's power can a werewolf be truly put to rest.
> 
> A spell of removal can also cure an afflicted lycanthrope, though those who accept the beast may fight it bitterly. As for those unfortunate souls born under the curse, they are doomed to bear their affliction for life. As far as my research has shown, there exists no cure, no respite for such individuals. They are caught in an eternal struggle, forever haunted by the wolf within.
